We do our best to make every next version fully compatible with the previous one, but sometimes big changes requires you to make minor changes in your code when upgrading to a new version.

_Note: you can check the Charting Library version by executing `TradingView.version()` in a browser console._

Here is the list of breaking changes:

  We made this change to speed up the loading of the library and get rid of possible vulnerabilities that may occur when loading a file.
  You just need to move the code of your custom indicators from the JS file to the widget constructor, wrapping them in a function and a Promise

**Trading Terminal**

We've changed the broker's interaction flow. Please read the following carefully to understand what changes should be made in your code to switch to the new version.

Till now the Trading Terminal called broker adapter's methods (e.g. `placeOrder`, `modifyOrder`) when user clicked on Buy/Sell/Modify buttons. When calling these methods the Trading Terminal passed a `silently` argument. When `silently` was set to `true`, the broker adapter could send an order without showing the dialog. When it was set to `false`, the broker adapter had to invoke a method from the `host` to show the order ticket (or the Edit Position dialog).

Starting from 1.15 the Trading Terminal shows all dialogs by itself and invokes broker adapter's methods to send an order or a position to the broker's server. The reason for this change is that we've added an order panel that can be used to place an order at any time.
If you use your own order dialog then you still need to make changes in your broker adapter's methods, but additionally you need to use `metainfo` to pass the dialog constructor to the Trading Terminal.

- Argument `silently` was removed from `placeOrder`, `modifyOrder`, `reversePosition`, `closePosition`, `closeTrade`, `cancelOrder`, `cancelOrders` methods of the [Broker API](Broker-API).

- Arguments `handler` and `options` were removed from `showOrderDailog` method of the [Trading Host](Trading-Host).

- Argument `handler` was removed from `showPositionBracketsDailog` method of the [Trading Host](Trading-Host).

- `supportCustomPlaceOrderTradableCheck` flag is no longer supported.

- We pass the parent order to `modifyOrder` if it exists. If child orderâ€™s details are required while modifying the order you can get back this behavior by enabling `always_pass_called_order_to_modify` featureset.

## Version 1.14

- [createButton](Widget-Methods#createButtonoptions) returns `HTMLElement` instead of `JQuery`.
- [createButton](Widget-Methods#createButtonoptions) must be used after [headerReady()](Widget-Methods#headerready) `Promise` is resolved.
- [getVisibleRange](Chart-Methods#getVisibleRange) returns `{from, to}` in the UTC timezone (it was a timezone selected on a chart before).
- Method `onready` was removed. You can use `window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', callback, false)` instead.
- `saveAsSnapshot` parameter was removed from [saveChartToServer](Widget-Methods#savecharttoserveroncompletecallback-onfailcallback-options)

**TypeScript type definitions**

- `StudyInputValueType` type is renamed to `StudyInputValue`.

**Featureset**

- Starting from this version you are no longer able to use the `keep_left_toolbar_visible_on_small_screens` featureset. This featureset is removed and the left toolbar visibility no longer depends on the screen size.

## Version 1.13

- Action `takeScreenshot` from [executeActionById](Chart-Methods#executeactionbyidactionid) method is removed. Use [takeScreenshot](Widget-Methods#takescreenshot) method instead.
- Action `lockDrawingsAction` from [executeActionById](Chart-Methods#executeactionbyidactionid) and [getCheckableActionState](Chart-Methods#getcheckableactionstateactionid) methods is removed. Use [lockAllDrawingTools](Widget-Methods#lockalldrawingtools) instead.
- Action `hideAllDrawingsAction` from [executeActionById](Chart-Methods#executeactionbyidactionid) and [getCheckableActionState](Chart-Methods#getcheckableactionstateactionid) methods is removed. Use [hideAllDrawingTools](Widget-Methods#hidealldrawingtools) instead.
- Featureset `caption_buttons_text_if_possible` is enabled by default.
- Fixed an [issue](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/2652) that was causing bars to shift. Time-shifted bars used to appear when daily bars had a negative exchange timezone offset along with a 24x7 session. If you have a workaround for this issue, please remove it before updating to this version.

## Version 1.12

**Charting Library**

- `charting_library/charting_library.min.js` is now [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) module.

    If you only inline this script into HTML then nothing has changed for you.
    If you import it as a module you should import `widget`, `version` and `onready` functions directly from it.

- `searchSymbolsByName` is removed from `JS-API`, use `searchSymbols` instead.

Study overrides:

- Overrides for `Overlay` should be applied only via `studies_overrides` (and `applyStudiesOverrides` in runtime). In the previous versions you had to use `overrides` and `applyOverrides`). See [Studies-Overrides](Studies-Overrides) page.
- Starting from this version you are no longer able to override `showStudyArguments` and `showLastValue` using `options` keyword.

**Trading Terminal**

- `hasHistory` flag is removed. Use `historyColumns` to display History in the Account Manager.

The following items are still supported in the Trading Terminal, but will be deprecated in future versions:

- `subscribePL` and `unsubscribePL`. The broker should call `plUpdate` method of the Host every time the profit is changed.
- `supportDOM` is removed. DOM widget visibility can be set using `dome_widget` featureset.

**The Trading Controller is replaced with [Broker API](Broker-API)**.

The following changes should be applied to your Trading Controller implementation to move to new Broker API:

- Method `setHost` is removed. Host should be passed to the constructor of Broker API.
- Method `buttonDropdownItems` is removed. Broker API should update [Broker API](Trading-Host) using `setButtonDropdownActions`.
- Methods `configFlags` and `durations` are removed. Use [Widget Constructor](Widget-Constructor) fields instead.
- All methods that returned `$.Deferred` should be modified to return Promise.
- Method `chartContextMenuItems` is renamed to `chartContextMenuActions`.
- Method `isTradable` changed to return a Promise instead of a Boolean value.
- All string constants ("working", "buy" etc.) should be replaced with the appropriate number of constants.
- Position `avg_price` renamed to `avgPrice`.
- `tradingController` field in the [Widget Constructor](Widget-Constructor) is removed. Use `brokerFactory` instead.

## Version 1.11

**Trading Terminal**

The following items are still supported in Trading Terminal, but will be deprecated in future versions:

- `supportDOME` renamed to `supportDOM`.
- The signature of `showClosePositionDialog has been changed.
- `showEditBracketsDialog` was renamed to `showPositionBracketsDialog`.The signature has been changed.

## Version 1.10

- Default behavior of Volume indicator was changed.

    **Previous behavior**: Volume indicator is added/removed when an instrument or a resolution is switched depending on volume support by the instrument. You can get back to this behavior by disabling `create_volume_indicator_by_default_once` featureset.

    **New behavior**: Volume indicator is added when an empty chart is loaded for the first time provided that it is supported by an active instrument.

## Version 1.9

- We don't compile Pine scripts anymore. You can still use scripts that were compiled earlier.

## Version 1.8 of Trading Terminal

- The chart can no longer show active orders only. Appropriate methods have been removed.
- `showOrderDialog` receives an object instead of arguments list
- `showSampleOrderDialog` removed, use [showOrderDialog](Trading-Host#showorderdialogorder-focus-promise) instead
- `showOrderDialog` removed from [Broker API](Broker-API), use `placeOrder` and `modifyOrder` receive `silently` argument instead
- `reversePosition`, `closePosition`, `cancelOrder` have an additional argument `silently`.

## Version 1.7

- Starting from this version calling `setSymbol` with the same symbol is no longer enough. You should call `onResetCacheNeededCallback` from `subscribeBars` first. Then you can use `setSymbol` or new `resetData` method of the chart.
- JSAPI protocol version 1 is not supported anymore. `nextTime` and `noData` must be provided.

## Version 1.5

- Added `source` argument to MACD. You should change MACD creation code to pass `source` also.

    `chartWidget.chart().createStudy('MACD', false, false, [12, 26, "close", 9])`

## Version 1.4

- Override `transparency` is not supported anymore. We added transparency support to every color. Use `rgba` form to define a color with transparency. Example:

    `"symbolWatermarkProperties.color" : "rgba(60, 70, 80, 0.05)"`

## Version 1.3

- Override `paneProperties.gridProperties.*` is not supported anymore.

    Please use `paneProperties.vertGridProperties.*` and `paneProperties.horzGridProperties.*`
