:chart: All content on this page is related to [Trading Terminal](Trading-Terminal) only.

Broker API is a key component that enables live trading. Its main purpose is to connect our charts with your trading logic. In terms of `JS`, it is an `object` which is expected to expose the specific interface. Here is a list of API's **methods** that Terminal is expected to have.

## Required Methods

### constructor(host)

The constructor of the Broker API usually takes [Trading Host](Trading-Host).

### positions : Promise<Position[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request [positions](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#position).

### orders : Promise<Order[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request [orders](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order).

### ordersHistory : Promise<Order[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request orders history. It is expected that returned [orders](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order) will have a final status (`rejected`, `filled`, `cancelled`). This method is optional. If you don't support orders history, please set `supportOrdersHistory` flag to `false`.

### executions(symbol) : Promise<Execution[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request [executions](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#execution).

### trades : Promise<Trade[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request [trades](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#trade) (individual positions).

### chartContextMenuActions(e)

- `e` is a context object passed by a browser

Chart can have a sub-menu `Trading` in the context menu. This method should return an array of [ActionMetainfo](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#actionmetainfo) elements, each of them representing one context menu item.

### connectionStatus()

You don't need to return values other than `1` typically since the broker is already connected when you create the widget. You can use it if you want to display a spinner in the bottom panel while the data is being loaded.
Possible return values are:

```javascript
ConnectionStatus.Connected = 1
ConnectionStatus.Connecting = 2
ConnectionStatus.Disconnected = 3
ConnectionStatus.Error = 4
```

### isTradable(symbol): Promise<boolean | IsTradableResult>

This function is required for the Floating Trading Panel. The ability to trade via the panel depends on the result of this function: `true` or `false`. You don't need to implement this method if all symbols can be traded.

If you want to show a custom message with the reason why the symbol cannot be traded then you can return an object `IsTradableResult`. It has the following keys: tradable (`true` or `false`), solutions(`TradableSolutions`), reason (`string`) and shortReason(`string`). Reason is displayed in the order ticket while the shortReason is displayed in the legend.

`TradableSolutions` has one of the following keys:

- `changeAccount` - id of a sub-account suitable for trading the symbol

- `changeSymbol` - the symbol suitable for trading with current sub-account

### accountManagerInfo()

This function should return the information that will be used to build an account manager.
See [Account Manager](Account-Manager) for more information.

### placeOrder([order](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order), confirmId)

Method is called when a user wants to place an order. Order is pre-filled with partial or complete information.

`confirmId` is passed if `supportOrderPreview` configuration flag is on.

### previewOrder([order](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order))

Returns estimated commission, fees, margin and other information for the order without it actually being placed. The method is called if `supportOrderPreview` configuration flag is on.
The result will be an object with the following fields:

- `confirmId` - a unique identifier that should be passed to `placeOrder` method
- `info` - information about the order, which is a table that has the following structure: [OrderPreviewInfoItem](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#OrderPreviewInfoItem)[].

### modifyOrder([order](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order))

1. `order` is an order object to modify

Method is called when a user wants to modify an existing order.

### cancelOrder(orderId)

This method is called to cancel a single order with a given `id`.

### cancelOrders(symbol, side, ordersIds)

1. `symbol` - symbol string
1. `side`: [Side constant](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#side) or `undefined`
1. `ordersIds` - ids already collected by `symbol` and `side`

This method is called to cancel multiple orders for a `symbol` and `side`.

### editPositionBrackets(positionId, [brackets](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#brackets), customFields)

1. `positionId` is an ID of an existing position to be modified
1. `brackets` - new [brackets](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#brackets).
1. `customFields` - [CustomInputFieldsValues](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#CustomInputFieldsValues) or `undefined`

This method is called if `supportPositionBrackets` configuration flag is on. It shows a dialog that enables `take profit` and `stop loss` editing.

### closePosition(positionId, amount)

This method is called if `supportClosePosition` configuration flag is on. It allows to close the position by id.

The amount is specified if `supportPartialClosePosition` is `true` and the user wants to close only part of the position.

### reversePosition(positionId)

This method is called if `supportNativeReversePosition` configuration flag is on. It allows to reverse the position by id.

### editTradeBrackets(tradeId, [brackets](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#brackets))

1. `tradeId` is ID of existing trade to be modified
1. `brackets` - new [brackets](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#brackets).

This method is called if `supportTradeBrackets` configuration flag is on. It displays a dialog that enables take profit and stop loss editing.

### closeTrade(tradeId, amount)

This method is called if `supportCloseTrade` configuration flag is on. It allows to close the trade by id.

The amount is specified if `supportPartialCloseTrade` is `true` and the user wants to close only part of the trade.

### symbolInfo(symbol) : Deferred (or Promise)

1. `symbol` - symbol string

This method is called by the internal Order Dialog, DOM panel and floating trading panel to get symbol information.

The result is an object with the following data:

- `qty` - object with fields `min`, `max` and `step` that specifies Quantity, field step and boundaries.

- `marginRate` - the margin requirement for the instrument. A 3% margin rate should be represented as 0.03.
- `stopPriceStep` - minimal price change for stop price field of the Stop and Stop Limit order. If set it will override the minTick value.
- `limitPriceStep` - minimal price change for limit price field of the Limit and Stop Limit order. If set it will override the minTick value.

This method is called to change current account. If the account is changed synchronously `currentAccountUpdate` should be called, otherwise the connection status should be set to Connecting for the period of the account switching.

### subscribeEquity()

The method should be implemented if you use the standard order dialog and support stop loss. Equity is used to calculate Risk in Percent.
